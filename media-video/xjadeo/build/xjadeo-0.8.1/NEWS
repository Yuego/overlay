I'm feeling lucky that I've able to spend my sparetime (and some more)
on pushing xjadeo in the last two weeks! It's about time to refocus on 
using xjadeo, but there'll be ongoing low-pri development and support.

Luis has put it quite well in saying: 
  Ooooh, how has this baby grown up :_(   8-D 

check the TODO and doc/ for further information.
the docbook is available online at

xjadeo has been working fine for personal usage over few month now, and
though we lack time to clean up xjadeo, it's yet time for another release :)

-------------------------------------------
after 2 months of xjadeo-0.3 rewrite, testing and using
we find that the current xjadeo implements all features 
we expect from a simple video monitor :)

 New Features: 
  * XV, SDL, gtk display backends.
  * remote control API allows to interact with a running instance 
    of xjadeo. 
  * (independant) QT Graphical User Interface
  * MIDI MTC can be used as alternate synchronization source.

Robin Gareus has jumped aboard and carried xjadeo from a quick hack for my 
personal usage to the level of a distributable beta package, throwing in 
some improvements on the way for good measure. Many kudos to him!

The main problem people had so far to use xjadeo is to install the right 
set of libraries to build it.

Ffmpeg is especially problematic, since it is under heavy development and
is thus very unstable. Using only a minimal part of ffmpeg API, we had to 
make changes in xjadeo to accomodate three different changes in ffmpeg 
interface that broke xjadeo. 

WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! 

It is likely that ffmpeg will continue evolving in a non backwards compatible
way, so bear in mind that updating ffmpeg may break xjadeo.

xjadeo has been tested with the following versions of ffmpeg:

- ffmpeg-0.4.9-0.20041110.0.1.rhfc3.ccrma.i386.rpm
- ffmpeg-0.4.9-0.20050427.1.1.fc3.rpm

It has been tested in debian distros as well.

NEW FUNCTIONALITY

- Resizing the window will resize the movie as well. 

(CAVEAT: resizing a video frame to make it fit the window is a cpu expensive 
operation. If you are not comfortable with the screen size of your movie
it is more cpu efficient that you resize the file before loading it in xjadeo,
via, e.g., 'mencoder'.)

- Pressing Mouse button 1 - will resize the monitor window to the original 
movie size.

- Mouse button 2 and 3 adjust the window to match the movie aspect ratio.

- Scroll Wheel (button 4,5) stepwise decreases / increases the window size
maintaining the original aspect ratio.

Use your Window Manager kill button or CTRL-C  to quit xjadeo.

NEW OPTIONS

xjadeo accepts the following options:

-q, --quiet, --silent
	Inhibit usual output.

-v, --verbose
	Print more information.  

-k, --keyframes 
	Seek only to keyframes of the video. (improves performance but makes
	playing jerky or simply static if keyframes are not frequent ).

-t, --try-codec  
	Check  if the  given  video  file  can be played by xjadeo.  No window
	is opened in this mode.  The program exits with code 1 if the file
	format is not supported.

-f, --fps
	How often xjadeo updates the screen. The default is 10 fps (not
	the video file default)!

-h, --help
	Shows a summary of the options.

-V, --version
	Shows the version of the program.

-o --offset
	Time offset in video-frames. There is a machine-dependent time lag 
	between jack transport and video display. This option allows to 
	compensate for it.

NEW PACKAGING OPTIONS

Configuration files for building RPM and DEB packages have been added.
